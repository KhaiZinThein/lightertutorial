<h1>Discovery</h1>
<p>This tutorial is guiding the readers to make a mobile app, while this is my first time either.<br/>
I doubt that I am talented in either coding or making apps, however, it is breaking news for me to know that making an app is not equal to coding, which is making everything easier and more friendly.
Instead, generating an app idea will be the most formidable challenge for me, the producer. Therefore, I tried to browse on the Internet to inspire me until I saw the passage written by <i>Chris Ching</i>.
He reminded the public that "There are no new app ideas. Just riffs off existing ones." I sort of agree with him. Logically, improving or editing an existing app idea is always easier than creating a totally new app idea or even a web page.
Thus, I referenced his suggestions on generating app ideas, which are absolutely useful. To conclude, by making this tutorial for readers, I discovered that creating an app is not as difficult as we usually thought.</p>
