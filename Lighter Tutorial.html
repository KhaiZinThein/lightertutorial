   <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
   <p>To have a brand new start, this tutorial will teach and guide you to make your first mobile app. The process will only take around 15 minutes, which is just the time for listening to three or four songs, whereas it is nothing too complicated to make a basic app. There are always misconceptions that making apps or web pages is exactly equal to coding? People can just use tools to help with.</p>
   
   <p>In this day and age, the usage of apps is gradually becoming commonplace and essential. Supposedly, everyone owned at least one mobile phone, while mobile apps are the derivatives. According to the calculation of Statista.com, there are at least millions of published apps in different App stores, like Google Play and Apple App Store. Therefore, why do not you create a unique one, being one of the millions! </p>
   <center><img src="./Statista.com.png" width=80% height=auto max-width=100%></center>
   <p>If you are interested in and curious about the app creating process, however, you do not excel in this cyber world, you will find this tutorial useful! Lighter is going to provide you with a hand-by-hand and step-by-step tutorial without coding! Whether you are making it just for fun or for commercial use, this guide is also suitable for you. Let us get started!</p>
   
   <h2 id="Step1"><span>Step 1: Generate Your App Idea</span></h2>
   <p>You can probably skip to <a style="font-weight:bold"; href="#Step2">Step 2</a> if you have a clear mind about your app, else you need to think of an idea for your app first. I have several tactics and strategies on hand which will be helpful for you to generate your app idea. </p>
   <h3>Tactic #1: Remixing</h3>
   <p>Make some changes to an existing app or combine different components from various apps that you used before.</p>
   <p><div class="rainbow-text" style="font-size:26px; margin-left:48px;" >
	<span class="block-line"><span style="color:#ff0000;">This&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#ffdd00;">always&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#48ff00;">comes&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#00ff95;">out&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#0091ff;">with&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#4d00ff;">great&nbsp;</span><span style="color:#ff00d9;">results!</span></span></div></p>
   <p>For instance, <span>Slither.io</span> was a well-known game in the past few years from Lowtech Studios, however, another game with a similar concept, <span>Snake.io</span>, from Kooapps Games came out with a new fancy skin system to make the game to be more aesthetic and attract more players to install the game. </p>
   <p>Furthermore, there are tons of these examples, discover them in your daily life!</p>
   <h3>Tactic #2: Fixing difficulties</h3>
   <p>Create an app to fix the problems that you are facing in daily life. You always need to try to seek a solution to problems, while you can barely just ignore them. If the difficulties can be eliminated with an app, it is absolutely an adequate reason to make one!</p>
   <p>Write down all those ideas that you want from the app, to what extent the app can help you. Even if a related app is already published to solve this problem, you can still have your dream app that you may prefer to delete or add some functions of the app. You should keep in mind that there is never a perfect app, you can always make it better every little bit! </p>
   <p>Nevertheless, jot down all the features that you prefer to have on a list, <span>you will need all of them</span> when you start to make the app! </p>

.congrats {
    color: #F00;
    -webkit-text-fill-color: transparent;
    -webkit-background-clip: text;
    font-size: 50px;
    font-family: Arial Black, Gadget, sans-serif;
    -webkit-text-stroke-width: 2px;
    -webkit-text-stroke-color: #FF0000;
    -webkit-animation: animatedBackground_c 2s infinite alternate;
}

@keyframes animatedBackground_c {
    0% {-webkit-text-stroke-color: #ff8b00}
    10% {-webkit-text-stroke-color: #e8ff00}
    20% {-webkit-text-stroke-color: #5dff00}

</style>
   <p>Basically, you have built up a whole structure of the app, even if you clicked <span style="font-weight:bold">Save & Continue</span> without filling in any of the blanks, the app is also existed.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="Step5"><span>Step 5: Mission accomplished! Check the result.</span></h2>

   <center><img src="./src 18.png" width=50% height=auto max-width=100%></center>
   <center><p><span>Your app will be there after all these steps!<br/>Typically, the flow to open your app in 'Test Lab' will be shown as below:</span></p></center>

<h2><span style=background-color:#ffff66;>(Attention: The below steps are not the main purpose of this tutorial, therefore they will be introduced briefly only.)</span></h2>
<h2 id="Step6"><span>Step 6: Keep testing and debugging</span></h2>
<p>At this stage, you have made an app that belongs to you, but that doesn't mean it can be used normally. Whatever app that you were building, it is always necessary to spend time on testing and retesting the app. Skipping this step seems to save you, the developer, a great deal of time. However, there are always frequent bugs that interrupt the app's functioning. However, these are completely avoidable by debugging.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="Step7"><span>Step 7: Publishing <span style="color:#a1a1a1";>(In case you are planning to earn money using the app)</span></span></h2>
<p>After eliminating all those bugs, the producer can try to publish the app via different app stores, for example, Google Play and Apple App Store.</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="Step8"><span>Step 8: Promote the app</span></h2>
<p>No matter how great the appearance of your app is and how useful it is, it will never be discovered by the public without promotion. As a merchant, promoting your app is always necessary. Shouting out from an influencer or KOL may be the key to success!</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="Step9"><span>Step 9: Ask for feedback</span></h2>
<p>ALL Feedback is essential to the producer. Users can usually discover various defects when they are using the app. The producers should build up long-term communication with the customer to bolster app development every little bit.</p>
